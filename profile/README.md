### Framework

The Xernerx Framework is the main focus in xernerx, it's a lightweight highly customizable Discord.js framework. Including a command handler that can handle slash, context and message commands. An event handler that can handle both process and client. And much more!

### Extensions

Extensions extend things that the framework doesn't have by default, this is to keep the package lightweight and only ship what is best for you. You can create your own extensions with the [xernerx-extension-builder](#xernerx-extension-builder)!

### Builders

#### Xernerx-extension-builder

This is a standalone package that's solely used to use for building extensions. This is shipped with the framework by default.
